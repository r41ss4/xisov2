- **`before_payin_insert`, `before_payout_insert`, `before_deposit_insert`**: Automatically generates unique transaction IDs (`payin_id`, `payout_id`, `deposit_id`) for each transaction before insertion.


## Foreign Key Constraints

- Foreign keys enforce relationships between tables:
    - `user_cards(user_id)` references `users(user_id)`
    - `usd_accounts(user_id)` references `users(user_id)`
    - `deposit(merchant_id)` references `merchant(merchant_id)`
    - `payin(provider_id)` references `financial_provider(provider_id)`
    - `payout(provider_id)` references `financial_provider(provider_id)`
    - `payin(usd_account_id)` references `usd_accounts(usd_account_id)`
